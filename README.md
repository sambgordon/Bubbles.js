# ResponsiveBubbles-2
This is a jQuery-based app that generates bubbles in a full-screen instance of Canvas, which respond to mouse movement.
Bubbles are generated randomly within the bounds of the screen, and an artificial "gravity" pushes them toward the bottom.

## List of variables used (so you can search them easily):
defaults = declares global vars with default settings.

responsiveHover = Sets responsive hover based on canvas event listener boolean eval.

color = Color of bubbles.

hide = Whether or not to hide bubbles, expressed as boolean.

speed = Falling speed of bubbles.

windPower = Horizontlal velocity represented by velY.

Count = Count of bubbles on screen at any time.

Size = Size of bubbles.

force = intensity of bubble movement in response to mouse hover.

_________

## Try and mess with the force, windPower and speed! :)

## UPDATE: Like my fractal app, I have intentions on integrating a functional UI for certain parameters.
