# ResponsiveBubbles-2
This is a cool app that generates bubbles. I used Pete R.'s Let it Snow plugin as
a sort of framework.

velX is used to define a "wind power" effect, while velY is used to define a "falling down" or gravity effect.

List of variables used (so you can search them easily):

defaults = declares global vars with default settings.

responsiveHover = Sets responsive hover based on canvas event listener boolean eval.
Color = Color of bubbles.
Hide = Whether or not to hide bubbles, expressed as boolean.
Speed = Falling speed of bubbles.
windPower = Horizontlal velocity represented by velY.
Count = Count of bubbles on screen at any time.
Size = Size of bubbles.
force = intensity of bubble movement in response to mouse hover.
