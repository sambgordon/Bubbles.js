# ResponsiveBubbles-2
This is a cool app that generates bubbles which respond to mouse movement. I used Pete R.'s Let it Snow plugin as
a sort of framework.



List of variables used (so you can search them easily):

defaults = declares global vars with default settings.

responsiveHover = Sets responsive hover based on canvas event listener boolean eval.

color = Color of bubbles.

hide = Whether or not to hide bubbles, expressed as boolean.

speed = Falling speed of bubbles.

windPower = Horizontlal velocity represented by velY.

Count = Count of bubbles on screen at any time.

Size = Size of bubbles.

force = intensity of bubble movement in response to mouse hover.

Try and mess with the force, windPower and speed! :)
